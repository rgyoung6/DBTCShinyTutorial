# DBTCShinyTutorial
A step-by-step example on the use of the DBTCShiny package.

# Description

This repository contains the DBTCShiny package located at [rgyoung6/DBTCShiny](https://github.com/rgyoung6/DBTCShiny) . The Dada-BLAST-Taxon Assign-Condense Shiny package contains the foundational [DBTC](https://github.com/rgyoung6/DBTC) functions (able to be run through the command line) which have been wrapped in a Shiny application for easy user interface. The DBTC functions have four main outcomes...

  - Fastq file processing using Dada in R
  - Using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) amplicon sequence variants (ASV) can be searched against local NCBI or custom libraries
  - Assign taxa to the unique reads using NCBI taxon database through taxa names and/or taxaID's
  - Condense the resulting ASV taxonomic assignment tables to unique taxa with the ability to combine datasets (using different sequence libraries for the same reads, or results from the same samples for different molecular regions) into a combined results table
